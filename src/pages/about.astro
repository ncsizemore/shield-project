					The Syphilis and HIV Integrated Epidemiologic and Economic Local-level Dynamics (SHIELD) project 
					aims to bridge a critical gap in the current approaches to syphilis control in the US by developing 
					a comprehensive, local-level model that addresses both syphilis and HIV epidemiology and their 
					economic impact in the US.

						<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
							Syphilis rates have quadrupled over the past decade, reaching their highest levels since the 1950s. 
							One in every 1,300 US births in 2021 was complicated by congenital syphilis – a public health catastrophe. 
							Increases in syphilis have been seen across the US: 45% of counties have seen a doubling in primary, 
							secondary, and early latent syphilis over the past five years.

						<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-3 dark:text-blue-300">The Intersection of Syphilis and HIV</h2>
						<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
							The US syphilis epidemic is closely tied to the HIV epidemic. In recent years, 25-50% of US syphilis 
							infections occur among people with HIV (PWH). PWH have a disproportionately high risk of acquiring 
							syphilis, with reported incidence of 2% to 6% per year (up to 13% in young adults with HIV) – rates 
							an order of magnitude higher than for non-HIV infected peers.
						</p>
						<p class="mt-2 dark:text-gray-300">
							Furthermore, a diagnosis of syphilis often precedes HIV infection – up to 1 in 20 men who have sex 
							with men (MSM) were diagnosed with HIV within a year of syphilis diagnosis – and syphilis may play 
							a causal role in HIV acquisition.

					<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-3 dark:text-blue-300">Disparities and Patterns</h2>
					<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
						Syphilis and HIV both disproportionately affect racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities, and new 
						infections are concentrated among the young. 34% of cases of primary and secondary syphilis were 
						among men who have sex with men (MSM), and 57% were among those under 35 years old.
					</p>
					<div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 rounded-lg">
						<p class="font-medium dark:text-gray-200">
							Syphilis case rates among Hispanics were 2.4 times those of White Americans; Black Americans had a rate 
							five times as high. Rates of congenital syphilis in Hispanic mothers were twice that of mothers of 
							White race, and Black mothers experienced a rate four times that of White mothers.

						<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-3 dark:text-blue-300">Research Gap</h2>
						<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
							Despite extensive applications in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, there is a marked 
							lack of modeling studies focusing on US syphilis over the last decade. This gap hinders the effective 
							formulation of evidence-based policy to halt the rise of the US syphilis epidemic.

						<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
							The SHIELD model will characterize syphilis transmission, progression, HIV co-infection, and STI care 
							engagement, while accounting for age, racial and ethnic disparities, risk profiles, and social 
							determinants of health. We will calibrate our models to the 32 US cities which contain EHE priority 
							jurisdictions – comprising 60% of syphilis cases as well as 60% of HIV diagnoses in 2021.

					The Syphilis and HIV Integrated Epidemiologic and Economic Local-level Dynamics (SHIELD)
					project aims to bridge a critical gap in the current approaches to syphilis control in the
					US by developing a comprehensive, local-level model that addresses both syphilis and HIV
					epidemiology and their economic impact in the US.

							The Syphilis Crisis
						</h2>
						<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
							Syphilis rates have quadrupled over the past decade, reaching their highest levels
							since the 1950s. One in every 1,300 US births in 2021 was complicated by congenital
							syphilis – a public health catastrophe. Increases in syphilis have been seen across
							the US: 45% of counties have seen a doubling in primary, secondary, and early latent
							syphilis over the past five years.

							The Intersection of Syphilis and HIV
						</h2>
						<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
							The US syphilis epidemic is closely tied to the HIV epidemic. In recent years, 25-50%
							of US syphilis infections occur among people with HIV (PWH). PWH have a
							disproportionately high risk of acquiring syphilis, with reported incidence of 2% to
							6% per year (up to 13% in young adults with HIV) – rates an order of magnitude higher
							than for non-HIV infected peers.
						</p>
						<p class="mt-2 dark:text-gray-300">
							Furthermore, a diagnosis of syphilis often precedes HIV infection – up to 1 in 20 men
							who have sex with men (MSM) were diagnosed with HIV within a year of syphilis
							diagnosis – and syphilis may play a causal role in HIV acquisition.

						Disparities and Patterns
					</h2>
					<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
						Syphilis and HIV both disproportionately affect racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities,
						and new infections are concentrated among the young. 34% of cases of primary and
						secondary syphilis were among men who have sex with men (MSM), and 57% were among those
						under 35 years old.
					</p>
					<div class="mt-4 rounded-lg bg-blue-100 p-4 dark:bg-blue-900">
						<p class="font-medium dark:text-gray-200">
							Syphilis case rates among Hispanics were 2.4 times those of White Americans; Black
							Americans had a rate five times as high. Rates of congenital syphilis in Hispanic
							mothers were twice that of mothers of White race, and Black mothers experienced a rate
							four times that of White mothers.

						<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
							Despite extensive applications in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, there
							is a marked lack of modeling studies focusing on US syphilis over the last decade.
							This gap hinders the effective formulation of evidence-based policy to halt the rise
							of the US syphilis epidemic.

						<p class="dark:text-gray-300">
							The SHIELD model will characterize syphilis transmission, progression, HIV
							co-infection, and STI care engagement, while accounting for age, racial and ethnic
							disparities, risk profiles, and social determinants of health. We will calibrate our
							models to the 32 US cities which contain EHE priority jurisdictions – comprising 60%
							of syphilis cases as well as 60% of HIV diagnoses in 2021.

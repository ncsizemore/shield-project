		bio: "Dr. Parastu Kasaie is an Associate Scientist in Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH). With a multidisciplinary background in computer science, epidemiology, and computational disease modeling, she applies her expertise to study the epidemiology of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in both the U.S. and globally. Her research focuses on addressing complex epidemiological challenges, particularly those involving human behavior and the interplay between communicable and non-communicable diseases, using advanced computational simulation techniques. Her work is integral to designing more effective HIV prevention and care strategies, both locally and nationally. Dr. Kasaie currently serves as Principal Investigator (PI) of the Syphilis and HIV Integrated Epidemiologic and Economic Local-level Dynamics (SHIELD) models [NIH/NIAID: R01AI179776], a suite of models analyzing the syphilis and HIV epidemics in high-burden U.S. cities to inform targeted strategies for ending the HIV epidemic.",

Dr. Fojo completed his residency in internal medicine at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, followed by a General Internal Medicine Fellowship and a Master of Health Science (MHS) in Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Dr. Fojo's research is centered on developing dynamic transmission models for HIV, with a particular focus on innovative calibration techniques for high-dimensional parameter spaces. He is a principal investigator on the Johns Hopkins Epidemiological and Economic Model (JHEEM), which forecasts future HIV incidence across 15 key subgroups under various scenarios aimed at achieving the goals of Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE). Supported by NIH grant R01MD018539 (NIMDH), Dr. Fojo's work also contributes to the JHEEM2 framework, which serves as the summation engine for the SHIELD simulation model.",
